# About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile-photo.jpeg">

Hi! I am a recent Master's graduate from Cornell University where I studied Operations Research with a concentration in Data Analytics. Many of my previous internships and projects focused on using data science and analytics tools to develop solutions to business problems or provide actionable insight for decision-making. I am proficient in Python and have used many of the data science, machine learning, and natural language processing libraries available. I am also comfortable using SQL, R, C++, and Java and have used these languages in previous projects or coursework. 

I'm actively looking for full-time roles in data science, quantitative finance, or product management based in or near New York City. I am available to begin work immediately and would love to connect with you to discuss any fitting opportunities.

# Previous Experience

## PayPal: Decision Scientist Intern 
June 2022 - August 2022
* Analyzed the impact of U.S. PayPal merchants adding Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) competitors as payment options to their checkout pages
* Implemented time series analysis methods in R to estimate changes in PayPal purchase volume after PayPal merchants add a BNPL competitor using over 100 weeks of transaction data per merchant
* Used machine learning techniques to generate similarity matches for over 4,000 merchants for use in causal impact modeling
* Created an SQL methodology to extract and organize relevant time series data from over 40 million daily transactions, expediting future analysis of non-U.S. merchants by several weeks

## Johnson & Johnson: Data Scientist (M.Eng. Project)
January 2022 - May 2022

* Modeled Pulmonary Hypertension patient referrals to medical specialists for diagnosis and treatment with Uptravi and Opsumit prescriptions, which generate over $2.5 billion in annual revenue
* Developed a data pipeline using AWS, Dataiku, and Spark to process over 100 million medical insurance claims per year to map the patient referral network
* Utilized network analytics to identify general healthcare providers that referred Pulmonary Hypertension patients to expert cardiologists that accurately diagnosed the disease, shortening the diagnosis time by up to six months
* Created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize over 250,000 Pulmonary Hypertension patient referrals

## Peraton Labs: Data Science Intern
June 2021 - August 2021

* Built an interactive virtual dashboard for over 700 U.S. military bases using Plotly and Dash Python libraries to visualize cybersecurity anomalies in military Internet and communications
* Created a secondary developer-facing dashboard to display real-time health metrics and analyze the performance of the machine learning modelâ€™s course-of-action determination
* Directly collaborated with the project director and lead developer to design the user interface of the dashboards based on client priorities
* Implemented the dashboards in Docker containers for use in remote machines
* Developed a methodology to efficiently query more than 100,000 records of Prefect data from Elastic to use in the dashboards

## Dataminr: Research & Software Engineering Intern
June 2020 - August 2020

* Designed an approach to identify supply chain disruptions in real-time from over 5,000 daily Dataminr alerts using Looker
* Created a machine learning model to predict abnormal spikes in Twitter activity following supply chain disruptions using Pandas, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF and Word2Vec
* Investigated ways to detect early warning signs of future corporate action resulting from supply chain disruptions using natural language processing techniques
